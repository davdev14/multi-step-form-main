# MULTI-STEP-FORM-VALIDATION
## Description
Welcome fellow developers, this is a multiple step form coded in HTML, CSS and javascript to buy a subscription on a gaming plateform. The steps consist of 
1. putting in personal info such as name, email and phone number, all the inputs must be filled to moved to the next step by clicking the next button.
2. in the second step the user select his plan that is; arcade, advanced or pro and can choose to pay monthly or yearly. the user must select one to move on
3. on the third step the user can pick add-ons to his plan which will increase the total cost of his subscription, however he is free to move on without add-ons
4. step four is the finishing up stage where the user is shown the plan and add-ons he/she picked with their monthly or yearly cost depending on what he/she chosed and the total cost is displayed under.

I did this project to acctually get good understanding about how to creat a more complex form and manage the dependencies of each form.

NO big challenges on this project, its something for intermidiate level developers. However, i had some hard times styling the form with css.
